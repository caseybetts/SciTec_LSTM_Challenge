## Overview

[Provide a brief overview of the project, including its purpose, key features, and any other relevant information.]

## Model Architecture and Rationale

### Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Description of the input data.
- **Hidden Layers**: Description of the hidden layers, including their types (e.g., dense, convolutional, recurrent), activation functions, and any other relevant details.
- **Output Layer**: Description of the output layer, including the type of output (e.g., classification, regression) and the activation function used.

### Rationale

- **Why this architecture?**: Explain the reasoning behind choosing this particular architecture, such as its suitability for the problem at hand, its ability to capture certain patterns in the data, or its efficiency in terms of computational resources.
- **Alternatives considered**: Mention any alternative architectures that were considered and why they were not chosen.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

### Data Sources

- List the sources of the data used in the project.

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Describe the steps taken to clean the data, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
2. **Normalization/Standardization**: Explain how the data was normalized or standardized.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Describe the method used to encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
4. **Splitting the Data**: Explain how the data was split into training, validation, and test sets.

### Feature Engineering

1. **Feature Selection**: Describe the process of selecting features, including any criteria used (e.g., correlation, mutual information).
2. **Feature Creation**: Explain any new features that were created, such as interaction terms, polynomial features, or derived features from existing ones.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Describe how features were scaled, if applicable.

## Scalability Considerations and Trade-offs

### Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Discuss how the model can be scaled horizontally, such as by distributing the workload across multiple machines.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Discuss how the model can be scaled vertically, such as by increasing the computational resources on a single machine.

### Trade-offs

- **Computational Resources**: Discuss the trade-off between computational resources and model performance.
- **Model Complexity**: Discuss the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability.
- **Training Time**: Discuss the trade-off between training time and model accuracy.

## Running Locally
